// Package gockoboard implements some simple structures matching the Geckoboard
// custom widgets (https://developer.geckoboard.com) and encodes them to the
// required go-hostile JSON structures.
//
// While Geckoboards widget naming is somewhat inconsistent, I've chosen to
// keep it (and match Geckoboards naming closely), as it saves re-documenting
// each and every widget.
